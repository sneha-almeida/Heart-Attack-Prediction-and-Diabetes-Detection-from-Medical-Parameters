# Heart Attack Prediction and Diabetes Detection from Medical Parameters
The system makes use of Machine Learning algorithms to predict the risk of the following diseases:
1) Heart Attack 
2) Diabetes

The System is trained on the following medical parameters for each # Diabetes # using the Support Vector Machines Algorithm for classification:
1) Plasma Glucose
2) Diastolic BP
3) Triceps Skin
4) Serium Insuline
5) BMI
6) Diabetes Pedigree
7) Age
8) Class (This has values 0 and 1; where 0: No diabetes Detected) and 1: Diabetes Detected)
