# Heart Attack Prediction and Diabetes Detection from Medical Parameters
The system makes use of Machine Learning algorithms to predict the risk of the following diseases:
1) Heart Attack 
2) Diabetes

The System is trained on the following medical parameters using the Support Vector Machines Algorithm for classification:
1) Plasma Glucose
2) Diastolic BP
3) Triceps Skin
4) Serium Insuline
5) BMI
6) Diabetes Pedigree
7) Age
8) Class (This has values 0 and 1; where 0: No diabetes Detected) and 1: Diabetes Detected)

Similarly, the system was trained on the following set of parameters using Support Vector Machines Algorithm for Classification:
1) Age 
2) Gender
3) Chest Pain 
4) Resting BP
5) Cholestrol
6) Fasting Blood Sugar
7) Electrocardiographic
8) Maximum Heart Rate
9) Exercise Induced Angina 
10) Oldpeak
11) Slope of Peak Exercise
12) CA
13) Thal
14) Num (This is the class that predcits if the user is at the risk of a heart attack from the entered data; 1: Risk of heart Attack detected and 0: No Risk of Heart Attack)

The System further has the following features:
1) Detects the location of the user and 
2) suggets a Doctor that the user can visit, in case he/she is detected to have risk of any of the aforementioned diseases based on the location. 
3) Admin Panel
4) Ability to add Doctors to the system that are recommended to the user (These recommendations take place based on the location/proximity)
5) Simple user interface designed using Tkinter (Python's UI rendering engine)

The block diagram for the system is as follows:
